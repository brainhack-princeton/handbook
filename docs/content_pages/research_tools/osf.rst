`Open Science Framework or OSF <https://osf.io/dashboard>`_ is a free and open-source project management tool that helps researchers manage, store, and share research material (documents, code, data, pre-registration, preprints, etc) throughout the entire research lifecycle. 

* OSF HOME: A personal repository of public or private ‘projects’. Each project contains a wiki, file storage, ‘components’ (file structure), and tracks changes. Users also have the option to assign the project tags, copyright license, create a DOI, and integrate a number of ‘Add-Ons’  including GitHub, figshare, DropBox, Google Drive, Amazon S3, etc. The integration of Add-Ons allows the user to have an OSF repository without the need to duplicate research materials already available in other tools (such as data in a GitHub repository). 

* OSF REGISTRIES:  An open repository of pre-registrations for experimental science. Pre-registrations do not need to be discipline or subject-specific and can follow a number of templates including AsPredicted.org, Registered Report Protocols, Replication Recipe (Brandt et al., 2013), Post-Completion, etc. 

* OSF PREPRINTS: An open preprint repository. Preprints do not need to be from a specific subject or discipline. However, a number of preprint repositories use OSF’s open-source infrastructure, including PsyArXiv, MetaArXiv, and MindRxiv

Extras available to Princeton researchers  
=========================================
* `Princeton affiliation within OSF <https://osf.io/institutions/pu/>`_ 

Good to know  
=========================================
* Longevity: OSF has funding for the next 50 years.
* Individual file size limit: 50GB
* Storage limit per private project: 5GB
* Storage limit per public project: 50GB
* Additional storage can be added through the use of Add-Ons such as GitHub, figshare, or Dataverse
