`Code Ocean <https://codeocean.com/>`_ is a computational platform for computational reproducibility and seamless collaboration. It allows users to create, collaborate on, and run code using any open source language as well as MATLAB and Stata. Code Ocean uses containerization to package the code, data, and environment together, allowing researchers to run and reproduce work from any web browser without needing to install extra hardware or software (not even packages!) - no need to recreate the run environment.

Extras available to Princeton researchers  
=========================================
* Unlimited storage
* Unlimited compute time
* Priority support support@codeocean.com 

Good to know  
=========================================
* Data must be present in Code Ocean
* If working with very large data files, Code Ocean will work with you to import the data into Code Ocean.
