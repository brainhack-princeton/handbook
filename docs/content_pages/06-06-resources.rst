------------------

The following are a list of resources that might be helpful as you embark on your own fMRI journey!

Blogs, Tutorials, and Courses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `AFNI Bootcamp <https://www.youtube.com/c/AFNIBootcamp>`_
	A collection of YouTube videos that describe the theory/concepts of processing neuroimaging data using AFNI. It also shows hand-on usage of the graphical tools in the AFNI software package.
* `Andy's Brain Blog <https://www.andysbrainblog.com/>`_
	A blog by Dr. Andrew "Andy" Jahn where he posts tutorials and videos after neuroimaging analysis from start to finish! Importantly, he covers a range of popular software packages (e.g., AFNI, SPM, FSL).
* `codecademy <https://neurohackademy.org/course_type/lectures/>`_
	Want to learn how to code but don't know where to begin? Start here! You can learn how to code by doing it.
* `DartBrains <https://dartbrains.org/content/intro.html>`_
	Materials for an course by folks at Dartmouth College. It provides an introduction to in vivo neuroimaging in humans using fMRI, starting with how the MRI scanner generates data all the way to how this data can be processed and analyzed.
* `Data Carpentry <https://datacarpentry.org/>`_
	Lessons that provide an introduction to the computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research.
* `Meta-Resource of Meta-Resources for Cognitive Neuroscience <https://meta-meta-resources.org/>`_
	This isn't *Inception* but instead a useful took that centralizes recourses for cognitive neuroscience research. It has everything from free online tutorials/courses you can go through to funding opportunities and summer schools/workshops you can apply for and so much more!
* `Mumford Brain Stats <https://mumfordbrainstats.tumblr.com/>`_
	A tumblr maintained by Dr. Jeanette Mumford where she answers questions about the statistical analysis of neuroimaging data. She also has a `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ7gF0zm35FwrFpDND6DWeA>`_ with short video tutorials and lessons about different neuroimaging data analysis strategies.
* `Neurohackademy <https://neurohackademy.org/course_type/lectures/>`_
	Lots of online materials from a Neurohackademy, a summer school in neuroimaging and data science that is held at the University of Washington eScience Institute.
* `Neuroimaging Analysis Methods for Naturalistic Data <http://naturalistic-data.org/>`_
	An online book developed by folks at Dartmouth College (Drs. Luke Chang, Emily Finn, and Jeremy Manning) in collaboration with a lot of other cool people. It includes a collection of the state-of-the-art techniques used in analyzing naturalistic data, such as films or stories.
* `NeuroStars <https://neurostars.org/>`_
	Question and answer forum for neuroscience researchers.
