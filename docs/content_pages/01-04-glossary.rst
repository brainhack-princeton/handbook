Computing
---------

.. glossary::

	Container
		some software including all its dependencies bundled into a package to be able to run the software in multiple computing environments
	
	HPC
		high-performance computing
	
	Docker/Singularity
		platform to deliver software package (https://www.docker.com/)
	
	Job scheduler (slurm) 
		computer application that enables scheduling your script to be ran by a computing cluster (e.g. slurm)
	
	Terminal
		interface for typing commands
	
	Command line
		typing commands directly into a terminal, often used to do tasks easier remotely and/or automatic (compared to a GUI)
	
	GUI
		graphical user interface
	
	Vim
		*to be added*
	
	Mounting the cluster
		ability to access files directly that are saved on a remotely located set of high performance computers (i.e. cluster)
	
	SSH
		a secure channel to access a computer remotely
	
	Cluster
		set of connected high performing computers that can be accessed to get more computing power
	
	Bash
		command language
	
	Text editor
		what you need for editing python scripts in an easy way (outside of terminal) -- pycharm, sublime, spyder, etc.
	
	tmux
		allows terminal session to remain active without being visible

MRI Acquisition
---------------

.. glossary::

	Bandwidth
		range of frequencies associated with signal reception.

	DICOM
		commonly used image format for MRI images (as well as other types of medical images like CT etc). This is the format that you will get your MRI-images in when taking them from the scanner after data acquisition.

	Nifti
		common used data format for (f)MRI images

	GRAPPA / mSENSE
		two parallel acquisition techniques that can shorten the acquisition time or increase the spatial resolution in the same examination time

	iPAT
		*to be added*

	SMS
		simultaneous multislice technique, acceleration in data acquisition

	TE
		echo time, time between RF (radio frequency) pulse and receipt of echo signal

	TR
		repetition time, length of time between two consecutive epi images

	Voxel
		volume element within your MR-image, your MR-image is a 3D matrix and each element of this matrix is referred to as voxel.

	EPI
		functional MRI scan (echo-planar imaging)

	BOLD
		Blood-oxygen-level-dependent

	GRE
		Gradient Echo, MRI technique for T2-weighted imaging that requires gradient echo signal

	SNR
		signal-to-noise ratio, relative contribution of true detected signal and random background noise

	`Github <https://github.com/>`_
		platforms that allows you to save version controlled scripts
	
	`OpenNeuro <https://openneuro.org/>`_
		Free and open platform to share neuroimaging data

	`OSF <https://osf.io/>`_
		Open Science Framework, free and open source project management tool (often used for preregistration of research hypotheses and task designs (during or before data acquisition)
