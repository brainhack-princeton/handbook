   Welcome to the Princeton Handbook for Reproducible Neuroimaging! The handbook is currently under active development—expect substantial changes in the near future. The goal of this handbook is to provide a reference for best practices in reproducible fMRI research. There’s no single “right” answer for many questions in fMRI, but here we try to provide helpful references and recommendations. Many elements of the handbook are specific to the Princeton Neuroscience Institute computing infrastructure, but the principles are widely applicable. This document will be updated over time as best practices evolve. We hope that this handbook will be useful as you embark on your own journey doing fMRI experiments!
